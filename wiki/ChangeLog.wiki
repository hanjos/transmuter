= 0.2-SNAPSHOT =
  * Changed `Binding`'s `validate` to `initialize`.
  
  * Created a `Binding` subclass called `Converter` which ensures we have a well-formed converter binding.

  * `Transmuter`'s `register` now takes an `Iterable` of converters, so an object with `@Converts` isn't stricly needed anymore.

  * Several providers which use the `Iterable` protocol to read objects with `@Converts` methods are given.

= 0.1 =

  * First release.
