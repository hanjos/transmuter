= Introduction =

This page is a brain dump for future features, refactorings, TODOs and stuff which may be implemented sometime. Dunno which version, when, or if they'll ever make it in...


= Stuff =
== TODOs ==

  * Rethink the validation process (especially for Pair and Binding) to ease overwrite-ability (it's a word -- or could be :)). Maybe the ability to register validators with some pre-implemented ones (could be a separate mini-project).

  * Investigate a better workaround for bug 4819108 in the JVM.

  * Figure out what should happen when a private method is marked with @Converts. Should be ignored (silent bugs suck) or should an exception be thrown (extra effort needed to check them just to signal errors). Methinks a new parameter has just shown itself :)


== New Stuff! ==

  * A Converter interface. (A lot) Less checking needed, but not sure how a Converter implementation with @Converts methods will work. Does just marking the Converter method with @Converts do the trick (I think so)?
  
  * Implement some search algorithm for a most compatible converter if a perfect match isn't found. Parameterizing it seems good...

  * If lots of optional parameters show up, a DSL would be cool.
