#summary How to make a Transmuter release
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Steps =

== Source Control ==
  * Run `mvn release:clean release:prepare` (*not* `release:perform`!). This will update the POM to the new version and store the new version in SVN's `tag` folder.
  * Run `mvn deploy`, which will publish the new version to a local directory in your machine.
  * Commit the new version to the `repos/releases` folder. This is what `release:perform` was supposed to do, but for some reason doesn't... :(

== Library ==
  * Upload the generated library to the [http://code.google.com/p/transmuter/downloads/list Downloads tab].

== Documentation ==
  * Generate the docs separately. 
  * Commit them to `tags/<new-version>/docs`. Take care of the `svn:mime-type` to ensure the docs are configured to be read as HTML instead of text.
  * Add a link in the [http://code.google.com/p/transmuter/ main page] to the new documentation.
