Transmuter
==========

Transmuter is a library for keeping several converters under one single object, which acts both as a converter 
registry and a single point of access for your conversions.

So, instead of having to store several converters all over your application, you can just register them at a 
transmuter and have it search for the converter best suited for your current needs.

Migration
=========

This repository is being imported from its original [Google Code home](https://code.google.com/p/transmuter/).
Although it's a small codebase, it also isn't being used for anything, which means I'm in no hurry to finish things. So, 
paraphrasing John Carmack, "It'll be done when it's done." :)
